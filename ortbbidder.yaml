# oRTB Adapter is a generic adapter; hence, ideally, it should not contain any bidder information.
# However, just to satisfy the requirement of the bidder-info validation framework, the following data is being added.
# Please refer to the YAML file of the actual instance of the oRTB Adapter (example-ortb_magnite.yaml) placed in the static/bidder-info-ortb directory.
